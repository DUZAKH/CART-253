## Description

This is meant to get the programmer, me, comfortable with using javascript and some of its functions. 
The aesthetic and subject of the game arose from a conversation with a classmate about my fear of coding and longing for ancestral pastoral activities. 
I am always shocked to meet people who have never touched wildlife. I hope to higlight this ironic aspect of modern human life through the digital display of a very real and human-dependant fauna which cannot shed its own fur due to domestication.
